There are two primary folders, "legacy" and "internship". "Internship" is of primary interest, it contains the progress on
the project so far. "Legacy" contains all the code from my third year project, it is included as it contains simpler 
versions of the Discrete Vortex Method in "Intership", so may be used to aid understanding. 

In "Internship" there is a folder called "Multi Sheet Project", this folder is a unity project that contains the majority 
of the project. There are multiple scenes included, each with a different purpose. The main body of work is contained in
"streamSimulator.cs", "DVM.cs" is an earlier version of this script and should not be confused with "streamSimulat.cs"
(though they essentially do the same thing, streamSimulator is much more flexible and optimized).
